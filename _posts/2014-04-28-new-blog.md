This is a new blog! It's being run on [Hugo][hugo] and uses a Hugo port of the
[Hyde][hyde] theme that I've open sourced [here][port].

[hugo]: http://hugo.spf13.com/
[hyde]: http://hyde.getpoole.com/
[port]: https://github.com/ciarand/hyde-for-hugo

I'll post a little more about the details of the engine in the future, including
how the porting process went, some problems I've encountered, and more.
