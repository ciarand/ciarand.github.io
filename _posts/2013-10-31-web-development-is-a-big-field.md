    Thoughts on where I'd like to go within the field of web development

I've been thinking a lot about what I'd like to be doing inside this big
buzzword we know as web development.

I really like writing internal tools, tests, and introducing new systems to help
myself and the other developers on a team work more efficiently and effectively.

I also love the mental acrobatics that writing a scaling application requires
from a developer; stuff like database normalization and writing cache-friendly
application structures excites me.

Finally, I *know* how to write scalable CSS. I like a lot of the concepts there
from a theoretical standpoint, but my experiences with designers so far have
left me frustrated and unhappy. I'm positive that there are designers that are a
real pleasure to work with, but I have not had that pleasure.

I guess what I actually want to do doesn't matter as much. It's a very nebulous
thing. On the other hand, there's a whole set of things I now know I *don't*
want to do.

On a related note, starting in 2014 I'll be available full time for any new
development work. If you'd like to start a conversation, you can email me at
[me@ciarand.me][email].
