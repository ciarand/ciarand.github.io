title: Using systemd template files

    I ran into some problems setting up systemd template files. Here's how I
    solved them.

Arch Linux ships with [systemd][] as the system management daemon. It's very
cool, but I struggled for an embarassing amount of time with getting it to start
[envoy][] (an ssh-agent management tool). The problem I encountered was mostly
due to my naÃ¯ve assumption about the autocompleted service files.

Specifically, bash autocompleted

```bash
systemctl enable envoy
```

To:

```bash
systemctl enable envoy@service.service
```

I didn't really know what the "@" meant, so I assumed it was correct and ran
with it. On my next restart it failed, and after some research I finally figured
out why. The "@" in systemd filenames signifies that the file is a "template"
file. There's a really good explanation on [stackoverflow][]. Here's the
relevant part:

Basically, the part after the "@" and before the extension (".service" in this
case) is a variable that's used inside the service file. I disabled
"envoy@service.service", enabled "envoy@ssh-agent.service" and reloaded systemd.
Everything's working now and I understand systemd better.

As a sidenote, I found the following commands to be really helpful in debugging
problems related to systemd:

```bash
# Show a service file's details, including file location
systemctl show [service name]
# Show failed units
systemctl --failed
# Show all logs this boot (-b) related to that service file
journalctl -b | grep [service name]
```
