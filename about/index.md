My name is Ciaran Downey, and this is my personal blog. I'm an experienced web
developer with a passion for making beautiful things and then shipping them.

I frequently contribute to open source under my GitHub account
[(@ciarand)][github]. If you're interested in chatting, you can email me at
<code@ciarand.me>.
